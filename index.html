			Welcome to the Horrors of Liander Castle. This is a browser-based game that combines solving 
			mind-boggling puzzles with storytelling. It is kind of like a digital version of an escape room, 
			except thereâ€™s no time limit and you can leave and return every time you want. The levels will get 
			progressively harder and will (hopefully) keep you busy for hours! Feel free to play alone or with
			friends.
			<br><br> 
			Each puzzle consists an image, clues and flavor text. To solve the riddle, use the image and clues
			that are given. The flavor text is just there to tell a story (add some 'flavor') and will never 
			hold any clues. To add even more flavor, each puzzle also contains music (if your web-browser 
			supports it). However, it is possible to mute music if you'd like to. 
			<br><br> 
			This game is best played on a laptop or a desktop. Smaller screens like mobile phones will be too
			small to see all the details needed to solve the puzzle. Also make sure your brightness is set to
			maximum. Liander Castle can be a dark place!
			<br><br>
			The first five levels are tutorials that will guide you through all the basics. After the tutorials,
			you will be challenged...
